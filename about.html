    <h1> About this Website</h1>
    <br>
    <p> [Name of website} is here to provide you with honest information about contraception, to help you weigh up the pros and cons of each, and help you stay healthy and safe. Every person has a right to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health.</p>
    <br>
    <p> In the England, men and women can access contraception from GP surgeries, sexual health clinics, and community contraception clinics, and some GUM (genitourinary medicine) clinics. Unfortunately, one third of women are not able to access contraception from their preferred source. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Access to modern and effective contraception means that women and men can stay healthy throughout life, ensuring that if pregnancy is desired it occurs at the right time, and improves the health of the baby they might have in the future. Family planning also prevents unintended pregnancies, reduces the need for abortions, and prevents the death of women and children.</p>
